                                            In this digital world, almost all of the top industries like the travel industry, banking, education, research, military, food etc. are now mostly software driven. Among all the programming languages, most industries use Python and for this reason I call Python <b><i>“the tech sauce”</i></b> due to its usability in almost all of the major leading industries of the world.
                                            <br>

                                            In this article, I talked about the various applications of python so that you can know its applications and select your preferable field/fields and learn python accordingly and efficiently. I also wrote about how some of the renowned companies are now using Python.

                                            <br>
                                            <h2>Why learn Python?</h2>
                                            Before going to its major applications let us learn about frameworks and libraries.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> 
                                            <u>Frameworks</u> are a collection of modules and packages. Frameworks are codes written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way. A framework inverts the control of the program or, it controls the algorithm itself. It tells the developer what it needs in order for the program to work. They automate common processes and implementation.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            <u>Libraries</u> are also codes that are written by someone else that aids in performing common tasks in python, but a library doesn’t tell the developer what they need like a framework. Rather, the programmer calls the library whenever and wherever they need it.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how “opinionated” it is or in how many ways the library or framework will let you write the code.
                                            <br>

                                            Python and its popular frameworks like Django and Flask are used to create many websites. Also, python is used to power functionality, security, easy scalability, convenience in the development process, manage user accounts, and manage databases, among other things. Python also has one of the largest collections of libraries that not only enhance the functionality of web applications but also make it easier to do so.

                                            To put it simply, AI is decision making and ML allows systems to learn new things from data. With Python’s stability and security, it can easily handle the intensive computations that keep the AI and ML systems running. Some of the most popular libraries for this cause are: SciPy (for scientific and technical computing), Pandas (for data analysis and manipulation), Keras (for Artificial Neural Networks), NumPy (or complex mathematical functions and computation), TensorFlow (for Machine Learning tasks, especially Deep Neural Networks), Scikit (for working with various Machine Learning models).

                                            In today’s world, there is a lot of data and it is important for every business to sift through that data in order to make money with maximum efficiency. Here, python plays a necessary role to extract the valuable data that can be used to take measured risks and profit incrementation. Using extracted data and Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, you can study data that you have and can easily perform several data analysis operations. For data visualization, there are different libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib which are used to plot graphs and charts and extract valuable information from the available data.

A very important area of application of such text processing ability of python is for NLP (Natural Language Processing). NLP is used in search engines, newspaper feed analysis and more recently for voice -based applications like Siri and Alexa. Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a group of libraries that can be used for creating such Text Processing systems.
